  "description": "Variables can be defined and then used as the playbook is executed. Variables are stored in a 'dictionary' where the key is the name of the variable and the value is a 'variable' data type. Variables can represent stateful elements that may need to be captured to allow for the successful execution of the playbook. All playbook variables are mutable unless identified as a constant. The scope of a variable is determined by where the variable is declared. A variable may be defined globally for the entire playbook or locally within a workflow step. Variables are scoped to the object they are defined in, and any object that is used or referenced by that object. A specific variable can only be defined once, however, a variable can be assigned and used in the object where it is defined or in any object used or referenced by that object (e.g., a playbook variable can be assigned at the playbook level but also reassigned a different value within a workflow step). Variables are referenced by using the key name from the dictionary with a suffix (keyword) of ':value'. For example, if you had a variable in the dictionary called '__ip_addresses__', one could reference this and use it in a playbook by using '__ip_addresses__:value'. Variables MAY be passed to and from external playbooks provided that system supports passing of arguments when the system function is invoked or returns its results.",
